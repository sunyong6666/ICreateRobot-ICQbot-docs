# Quick Start

If you are using this product for the first time, please read this chapter carefully to quickly learn how to use ICQbot to make some simple cases. 


## Voice Programming Control  
In this section, we will use the ICQbot Xiao Q Robot, voice recognition sensor, and motor to create a fan controlled by voice commands. Through this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of how voice commands interact with hardware modules.

| c、 Start using the fan:  <br/>+ First, wake up ICQbot by saying "Hello, Xiao Q."<br/>+ Use voice commands like “Motor one forward/backward” to control the fan's rotation.<br/>+ Say “Stop motion” to stop the motor. | |




## Software Programming Control  
In this section, we will guide you through creating a voice-controlled stage character. This project will help you understand how to use voice commands to manipulate stage characters effectively.
